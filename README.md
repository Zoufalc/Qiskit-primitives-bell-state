# Using Qiskit Primitives to make a Bell state

This repository contains a short introduction to qubits, gates and simple circuits. Furthermore, it introduces important properties of quantum computers, i.e., superposition and entanglement. By employing the introduced elements, we can now create a quantum circuit that prepares a Bell state.
Finally, we demonstrate the practical execution of the respective quantum circuit using Qiskit Runtime Primitives and illustrate the power of 
error mitigation techniques.
