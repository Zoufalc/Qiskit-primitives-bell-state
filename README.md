# Using Qiskit Primitives to make a bell state

This repository contains a short introduction to qubits, gates and
the Qiskit Runtime Primitives.  It contains simple circuits to 
demonstrate basic gates, superposition and entaglement leading to
creating a Bell State.  It additional demonstrates the power of 
error mitigation techniques available in the primitives to improve
result quality.
